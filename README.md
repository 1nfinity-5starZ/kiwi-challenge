Kiwi.com development challenge

The project consist of two folders: 'client' and 'server'.

Cloning the project and running 'npm run install-all' and then 'npm start' will automatically install dependencies of both folders and start both servers using concurrently.

It is also possible of course to do it individually for each folder.

Unit tests were implemented only on client side, as it was a more complex project than the server.
Typescript was also used only in the client side.

As the server was pretty simple I coded it from stratch, but the client was initialized using create-react-app with the typescript template.

A word filtering feature was implemented using a JSON dictionary provided by https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.

The stack used for front-end was React, Apollo Client, Typescript, Styled-Components and all the UI was done by hand, no lib needed.
The back-end was created using Apollo Server and plain Javascript.

I'm really happy with the result and please if you have any questions or problems running the project contact me right away !
